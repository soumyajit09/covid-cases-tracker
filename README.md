# Covid Cases Tracker
The following project track Covid-19 cases of a country using Python. In this project to visualize the data more effectively I have graphed the data using pie chart. In the pie chart we can see the percentage share of recovered patients, active patients, and the patients who lost their lives due to covid in a particular country.

## Prequisites 
1. Download the **covid** library using the following command in command prompt :
  -*pip install covid*-
2. Download the **matplotlib** library using the following command in command prompt : 
  -*pip install matplotlib*-
